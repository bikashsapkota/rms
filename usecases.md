### Workflows

This section describes the end-to-end user flows for key processes in the system.

#### Restaurant Acquisition Workflow (With Admin Approval)

This workflow describes how a new restaurant owner onboards their restaurant onto the platform using an approval-based model.

1.  **Application Submission:** A prospective restaurant owner fills out a sign-up form with their restaurant and admin user details.
2.  **System Creates Pending Account:** Upon submission (`POST /setup`), the system creates an `Organization` and `Restaurant` with a `pending` status. The associated `User` account is created but remains inactive. The applicant is shown a "Pending Approval" message.
3.  **Super Admin Review:** A Super Admin logs in and views a list of all pending applications (`GET /platform/applications`).
4.  **Application Approval/Rejection:** The Super Admin reviews the application details and decides to either:
    *   **Approve:** The Super Admin calls `POST /platform/applications/{org_id}/approve`. The system changes the status of the organization/restaurant to `approved` and activates the associated admin user account. An email notification is sent to the restaurant owner.
    *   **Reject:** The Super Admin calls `POST /platform/applications/{org_id}/reject`. The system changes the status to `rejected` and sends a notification. The data may be archived or deleted based on platform policy.
5.  **Activation and Login:** Once approved, the Restaurant Manager receives the confirmation email and can now log in with their credentials (`POST /auth/login`) to start managing their restaurant.
